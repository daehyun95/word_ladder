Word ladders<br/>
A word ladder is a connection from one word to another formed by changing one letter at a time with the constraint that at each step the sequence of letters still forms a valid word.<br/>
<br/>
For example, to change the word "data" into the word "code", we could do the following. Each word from right to left changes a single letter from the word before it (and yes, "dade" and "cade" are both English words, albeit very uncommon ones):<br/>
<br/>
data dada dade cade code<br/>
